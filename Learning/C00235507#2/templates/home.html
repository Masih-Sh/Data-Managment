            <b>Welcome to my second assignment , the Word Game !</b><br>
            <b>Here is how to play it :</b> <br><br>

            You are provided with a word of eight letters or more which we'll call the "sourceword".<br>
            You are to think up seven 4-or-more letter words made up from the letters contained within the sourceword, ensuring that:<br>

            1.Each word is only made up from the letters contained within the sourceword.<br>
            2.You haven't reused any letter more times that it appears in the sourceword.<br>
            3.Each word exists within the dictionary (i.e., it's a “real” word).<br>
            4.The words all have four letters or more.<br>
            5.There are no duplicate words.<br>
            6.None of the seven words is the source word.<br><br>
            <b>Note</b>: case is NOT significiant (i.e., This, THIS, and this are the *same* word).<br><br>
