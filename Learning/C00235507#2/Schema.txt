for our database we are using MariaDB

we open MySQL and enter the password of the already built database we have over there 
password:itcarlow(all lower case)

in order to see the avaiable data base we use 

show databases;

now that we see the list of the avaiable databases , we are going to create a new one for our game.
we are going to call it project2_db

create database project2_db;

use show database to make sure our database is created.

now we have 6 rows.

in order to delete our database (if its needed) we are going to use :

drop database game4leaderboard_db;

now we create a user name and a password for our database by typing

grant all on project2_db.* to 'project2' identified by 'project2password'

give it a username and password.

##########################################
username: project2
password: project2password
############################################
out data base is created and our work on creating it is finished

============================================================================================

we leave by typing quit

then we type mysql -u project2 -p project2_db

then it will ask for the password and we enter the password

now we create the actual table for players

create table players (
->time float,
->name varchar(64) not null,
->sourceword varchar(64),
->userinput varchar(150));

now we check the table

describe players;

==============================================================================================

we need to make a new table for our logs as well

create table logs (
->result varchar(300),
->sourceword varchar(300),
->userinput varchar(300),
->time timestamp,
->ip varchar(300),
->explorer varchar(300));

now we chack the table 

describe logs
